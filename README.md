# N3LP
C++ implementation for Neural Network-based NLP, such as LSTM machine translation!

This project ONLY requires a template library for linear algebra, Eigen (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)

## USAGE ##
1) modify the line in Makefile to use Eigen<br>
EIGEN_LOCATION=$$HOME/local/eigen_new #Change this line to use Eigen

2) run the command "make"

3) ./run the command "n3lp", and then the seq2seq model training starts (currently)
